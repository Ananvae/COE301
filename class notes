#include <iostream>

using namespace std;   Access the standard namesapace (std) where all the standard C++ library names are declared

if u dont use the namespace std, u have to prefix std:: before every standard library name like std::cout, std::cin, std::endl
JUST 2 ALternatives of writing the code

the you have int main()  which is the main function where the execution of the program begins

return 0 indicates that the program ended successfully

cout stands fr character output, used to print text to the console

how does the computer convert C++ code to binary? 
the compiler translates the C++ code into machine code (binary) that the computer's processor can execute directly. 
This process involves several steps, including preprocessing, compiling, assembling, and linking.
G++ is a popular compiler for C++ that performs these steps to create an executable program from C++ source code.
Clang is another widely used C++ compiler known for its fast compilation times and helpful error messages.

C++ ususally complied the entore program before execution unlike interpreted languages like python where 
the code is executed line by line

terminal/console/command prompt - interface to interact with the computer using text based commands

terminal commands to compile and run a C++ program using g++ compiler:
g++ main.cpp -o main    // compile the code
./main                  // run the compiled program on Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS)

Debugging - process of identifying and fixing errors or bugs in the code to ensure it runs correctly

ex: 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello * World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
you might encounter errors like:
1. Syntax Error: If you forget a semicolon at the end of a statement, the compiler will throw a syntax error.
2. Runtime Error: If your program tries to divide by zero, it will result in a runtime error.
3. Logical Error: If your program calculates the wrong age due to incorrect logic, it will produce unexpected results.  


Humans represent numbers in decimal (base 10) system, using digits 0-9.
machines represent numbers in binary (base 2) system, using only digits 0 and 1.
3 bits can represent 2^3 = 8 different values (000 to 111 in binary, which is 0 to 7 in decimal).
incresing power of 2 increases the range of values that can be represented exponentially.
increasing the number of bits increases the range of values that can be represented exponentially.
increasing power of 10 increases the range of values that can be represented linearly.

in binary each digit represents a power of 2, starting from 2^0 on the right.

100101 in binary = 1*2^5 + 0*2^4 + 0*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 32 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 37 in decimal

if were gven a number say 19 
19 in decimal = 1*10^1 + 9*10^0 = 10 + 9 = 19
using division by 2 method to convert decimal to binary:
19 / 2 = 9 remainder 1
9 / 2 = 4 remainder 1
4 / 2 = 2 remainder 0
2 / 2 = 1 remainder 0
1 / 2 = 0 remainder 1
reading remainders from bottom to top gives us 10011 in binary  


method 2 desending powers of 2:
find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 19
2^4 = 16 is the largest power of 2 less than 19
subtract 16 from 19, leaving 3
next largest power of 2 less than or equal to 3 is 2^1 = 2
subtract 2 from 3, leaving 1
next largest power of 2 less than or equal to 1 is 2^0 = 1
subtract 1 from 1, leaving 0
we used 2^4, 2^1, and 2^0, so we place 1s in those positions and 0s elsewhere:
19 in decimal = 10011 in binary

ADDING TWO BINARY NUMBERS:
  1011   (11 in decimal)
0 + 0 = 0
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 0 = 1
1 + 1 = 10 (write down 0, carry over 1)


6 = 0110 because 0*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 0 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 6
7 = 0111 because 0*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 0 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 7

6 + 7 in binary:
  0110
+ 0111
-------
    1101   (13 in decimal)


    MULTIPLICATION IN BINARY:
  0110   (6 in decimal)
x 0111   (7 in decimal)
-------
  0110    (6 * 1)
 0000     (6 * 1, shifted one position to the left)
0110      (6 * 1, shifted two positions to the left)
-------
 11010    (42 in decimal)
