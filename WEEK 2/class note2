floating and double point numbers - follow IEEE 754 standard

Fractions in binary:
1/2 = 0.5, in binary 0.1
1/4 = 0.25, in binary 0.01
1/8 = 0.125, in binary 0.001
1/10 = 0.1, in binary approx 0.000110011001
1/3 = 0.3333..., in binary approx 0.0101010101... (repeating)

sign bit - 1 bit: (-1)^b31 = (-1)^0 = positive, (-1)^1 = negative
exponent - 8 bits: biased exponent, actual exponent = stored exponent - bias (127 for single precision)
mantissa - 23 bits: fractional part, with an implicit leading 1
value = (-1)^sign * 1.mantissa * 2^(exponent - bias)
Fraction (24 bits including implicit leading 1, 23 bits explicitly stored): {1,1 + 2^-23, ... , 2 - 2^-23}

The maximum 32 bit floating point number is approximately 3.4 x 10^38 which is 2 - 2^-23 * 2^128


a type refers to a "category" of data that tells the compiler how to interpret the bits stored in memory. Different types have different sizes and behaviors.

C++ has several built-in data types, including:
1. bool: Represents boolean values (true or false). Typically uses 1 byte of memory.
2. char: Represents a single character (like 'a', 'b', '1', etc.). Typically uses 1 byte of memory.
3. int: Represents integer numbers (whole numbers without decimal points). Typically uses 4 bytes of memory.
4. float: Represents single-precision floating-point numbers (numbers with decimal points). Typically uses 4 bytes of memory.
5. double: Represents double-precision floating-point numbers (more precise than float). Typically uses 8 bytes of memory.

Variables

variables can range from 1 to 8 bytes depending on the type
variables can range from 1 to 255 characters in length for strings (char arrays)
 begin all variable names with a letter or underscore, subsequent characters can be letters, digits, or underscores
 variable names are case sensitive
 cannot use C++ reserved words as variable names (int, float, return, etc.)
 cannot use anything other than letters, digits, or underscores in variable names (no spaces, hyphens, etc.)

count - yes
total_score - yes
2ndPlace - no (cannot start with a digit)
first name - no (cannot have spaces)
return - no (reserved word) 
total-score - no (cannot have hyphens)

Differences between C++ Arithmetic operators VS math operators

Floating point division vs integer division
In C++, the division operator (/) behaves differently depending on the types of the operands involved.
1. Floating Point Division: If at least one of the operands is a floating-point type (float or double), 
C++ performs floating-point division. This means that the result will be a floating-point number,
 and it can include decimal places.
Example:
float a = 5.0;
float b = 2.0;
float result = a / b; // result will be 2.5     
2. Integer Division: If both operands are of integer types (int, short, long, etc.), C++ performs integer division. 
This means that the result will also be an integer, 
and any fractional part will be truncated (not rounded).
Example:
int a = 5;
int b = 2;
int result = a / b; // result will be 2 (fractional part .5 is truncated)
Mixed-Type Division:
When one operand is an integer and the other is a floating-point type,
C++ will promote the integer to a floating-point type before performing the division.
Example:
int a = 5;
float b = 2.0;
float result = a / b; // result will be 2.5 (a is promoted to float)
To ensure you get the desired type of division, you can explicitly cast one of the operands to the desired type.
Example:
int a = 5;
int b = 2;
float result = static_cast<float>(a) / b; // result will be 2.5
In summary, C++ uses floating-point division when at least one operand is a floating-point type, 
and integer division when both operands are integers.
