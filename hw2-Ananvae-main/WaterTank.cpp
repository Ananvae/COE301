/* Problem 4
 Write a C++ program that
 (a). Asks a user to enter two numbers r and h, that represent the radius and height of the water tank respectively.
 (b). Computes the volume of the water tank as V = PI*r*r*h.
 (c). Displays the result on your screen with two fraction digits using printf (for example, 37.7778 should be displayed as 37.78).
 (d). Test your code by using r = 2.5, h = 2.4 and report the result.
