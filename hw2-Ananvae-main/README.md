# HW2
## Due Jan 30th 2026, 11:59pm

**Instructions:** 
* *For problem 1, 2 and problem 4(d), you can*

  *(a).type in this README by editing and commiting changes*

  *or*

  *(b). write the answer in a paper and take a picture, save the picture as .png or .jpg or .pdf. Upload the picture by adding files.*

* *For problem 3 and 4, do the same thing as HW1 or read Step 1 and 2 in Github_Desktop_and_pull_request.pdf in Files/Handouts/ on Canvas for a convenient way of downloading starter code and uploading updated code. Executable files are not neccesary. We only grade .cpp files.*

* *Problem 5 is optional with Bonus points! Learning this will be helpful for collaborative coding and debugging. It is the best way to interact with us in homework coding questions as well.*

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Problem 1. [20 points]
We have two decimal numbers: -12 and 27

(a). Convert them into **8-bits** binary **signed** integers

(b). Perform the binary addition and multiplication

(c). Covert the result from (b) to two decimal numbers

## Problem 2. [20 points]
(a). Which of the following variable names are acceptable in C++?

`my_EID`, `UT-Austin`,`TotalIncome`,`return`,`!ex`, `Hook'em`,`2nd_game`,`_day1`,`I love coding`


(b). How many unique numbers can a 64-bit double varianle represent?

(c). What are the maximum and minimum values that a 16-bit **signed** integer can represent?

(d). What is the output of the following block of C++ code?

`int i = 2,j = 7;`

`cout << i << " " << j << endl;`

`i = j;`

`cout << i << " " << j << endl;`

(e). What is the output of the following block of C++ code?

`string myString = "I love C++.";`

`cout << "myString" << endl;`

`cout << myString << endl;`

`myString = "I love Python too.";`

`cout << myString << endl;`


## Problem 3. [20 points]
Read `myBinaryName.cpp` and run it. It should output "My name is Hannah" and also my binary name. Now edit the code and replace "Hannah" with your own name. Print your name and your binary name.

## Problme 4. [30 points]
Write a C++ program in `WaterTank.cpp` that

(a). Asks a user to enter two numbers `r` and `h`, that represent the radius and height of the water tank respectively.

(b). Computes the volume of the water tank as `V = PI*r*r*h`.

(c). Display the result on your screen with two fraction digits using printf (for example, 37.7778 should be displayed as 37.78).

(d). Test your code by using `r = 2.5, h = 2.4` and report the result.

*[Hint: check `myName2.cpp` and `myPrinting.cpp` in Lecture 4 and `type_and_operations2.cpp` in Lecture 5.]*

## Problem 5. [Optional] [Bonus 10 points]
Read through Github_Desktop_and_pull_request.pdf in Files/Handouts/ on Canvas. Please do this after you finish Problem 1-4, commit and push changes in main branch.

Follow the instructions on Step 3 of Github_Desktop_and_pull_request.pdf to pull a request for `myPullRequest.cpp`.
